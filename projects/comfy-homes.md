A minimal real estate website


### purpose and goal

Building a simple real estate website showing listings of properties for rent and sale in the seven emirates in the UAE.


### general requirements

The requirements i had in mind was the website must be fast and responsive.
I am to pull in the listing data from rapidapi (rest api) using the axiios library.


### stack explanation

After my introduction to the world of react and static site generation by gatsby I wanted to try another React-based framework, and nextjs seems to e the most popular alternative to gatsby. 
I decided to learn nextjs and preferred it to gatsbyjs so I migrated my portfolio website to nextjs.
I wanted to build another real-world project using nextjs and my favourite css framework, tailwindcss.


### experience and challenges

Working on this project was an interesting experience, I didn't face any major challenges barring some minor UI bugs.


### wrapping up

I learned how to integrate a real-world project to rest API service using Axios.
My responsive design skills improved greatly while working on this project.
