A minimal and beautiful JamStack blog built with react, nextjs and tailwindcss for the frontend coupled with Contentful Headless CMS for content management. 


### purpose and goal

Building a minimal and beautiful JamStack blog that non-technical users can update easily. 


### general requirements

The generated website must fulfill some requirements for me to call it a success.
The website must be fast and responsive.
The website must be SEO friendly.
It should be easy for others to customize and build upon.
Non-technical users should be a noble to add and update the site content. 


### stack explanation

The Contentful CMS documentation is an intuitive one, I enjoyed reading through it to get a good grasp of the content management system and its various APIs. 
I faced a few challenge while working with graphql but after reading a few documentations and seeing implementations from other developers I was able to use it to get the job done.
